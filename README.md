### Notes
The only challenge I had when creating this app was when I had to download CocoaPods. The issue I had was that I had MacOS Mojave and hadn't updated to MacOS Catallina yet. I decided to install CocoaPods on my computer without updating, but when I went to work in the workspace, it wouldn't let me import AlamofireImage. However, when I updated my computer, downloaded the latest version of Xcode, and re-installed CocoaPods the MacOS Catallina way, it ended up working.
